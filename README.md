# Saudi Arabian Real Estate Market Analysis

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a data analysis hackathon to analyze the Saudi Arabian real estate market using the **SA_Aqar dataset**. The primary goal was to uncover key trends, analyze market dynamics, and deliver actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

## Features
- **Dynamic Dashboards:** Visualized trends and patterns using **Power BI**.
- **Regional Analysis:** Examined pricing and sales data for key cities like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam.
- **Property Type Breakdown:** Analyzed demand and pricing across different property types, including apartments, villas, and lands.
- **Temporal Trends:** Investigated seasonal and yearly trends to identify market cycles.
- **Data-Driven Recommendations:** Provided actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI:** For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Microsoft Excel:** For initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applied to derive meaningful insights.

## Key Findings
- **Performance by Location:**
  - **جدة** leads in both Avg_Prices (112,881.88) and Avg_Size (485.68), positioning it as a premium market.
  - **الدمام**, with the lowest Avg_Size (326.84), offers an affordable but spacious alternative for buyers.

- **Impact of Property Age:**
  - Properties with age 32 dominate Avg_Prices (311,666.67), while those aged 36 have the lowest (46,428.57).
  - This shows newer or better-maintained properties yield significantly higher returns.

- **Property Size and Price Correlation:**
  - Larger properties command higher prices, with a strong positive correlation between Avg_Size and Max_Size, especially evident in **جدة**.

- **Market Distribution:**
  - A few key property features, like bedrooms and living rooms, significantly contribute to the overall property value, underscoring their importance in development and sales strategies.

- **Opportunity for Diversification:**
  - The wide range of Avg_Prices and property sizes across cities and property types highlights opportunities for market diversification.
